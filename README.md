The goal of this application is to provide a tool to search through all the classes offered at Brandeis
and to give lots of options of how to search the incredibly large course offering. In this app you can search
based on the subject, the professor's email, any key words, and by maximum class size. I felt like all four of
these are useful things to be able to use to search.

After a search, it pulls up a table of all of the results that matched the query, as shown below.
